The set of reachable configurations of the model, with the order induced by the transition rule defined on it, is the lattice of all partitions of an integer, equipped with a dominance ordering. We first explain how this lattice can be constructed by an algorithm in linear time with respect to its size by showing that it has a self-similar structure. Then, we define a natural extension of the model to infinity, which we compare with the original lattice. Using a self-similar tree, we obtain an encoding of the obtained lattice which makes it possible to enumerate easily and efficiently all the partitions of a given integer. This approach also gives a recursive formula for the number of partitions of an integer, and some information on special sets of partitions, such as length-bounded partitions.\"  \nExample:\n1.

A metal trap is by no means 100% effective and severe damage may occur before the uncrushable material can be removed.

When you start the mill, let it obtain full speed before feeding any material into it. Lastly, let the mill empty itself completely before shutting down. FEEDING: Material fed into a Schutte-Buffalo Hammer Mill should be spread evenly over the entire feed width and should be conveyed into the mill continuously and uniformlyat a rate not greater than what the mill will handle.

This smart sensor is part of the ICSSN and processes the camera images locally.\nThe proposed design of WeathercAIm is a camera connected to the ICSSN that also runs the precipitation type and visibility AI model.\nFor the machine learning (ML) model, a supervised learning approach is used for multiclass classification, using a classifier based on a CNN that has proven its merits in the computer vision field.\nAn initial model was trained on a public dataset, Adverse Weather Dataset (AWD), to evaluate the feasibility of detecting the mentioned weather parameters. The dataset contained most but not all weather classes of interest for SARWS and had a good balance between the classes.\nWe use a single CNN handling both precipitation type and visibility detection. The current implementation is a CNN with a ResNet50v2 backbone and a dense layer as classification head. The CNN is trained via transfer learning with fine-tuning, with the backbone network pre-trained on ImageNet. Cross-entropy is used as a loss function with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an optimizer. To counter overfitting, image augmentation, i.e. rotation, horizontal flip, translation, zoom and contrast, regularization and dropout layers are used. The CNN model is implemented in Keras/TensorFlow.\nWith this model we achieved good scores, with accuracy, F1, AUC all in the high 90%, indicating that WeathercAIm CNN can learn the weather classes with a good accuracy based on the given dataset.\nThis initial model was also deployed in ICSSN for the field test.\nInitial results from the field test revealed that there is still room for improvement in accuracy on real life production data.\nSome observations during the field test:\n\u25cf\tthe resolution of the camera does not allow for a high performance in changing lighting conditions, producing lesser quality images than the camera images from the AWD dataset\n\u25cf\tdifferent environmental setting, e.g. camera placement, urban scenes and weather conditions compared to AWD dataset, which were taken in Canada.\n\u25cf\tspecial (non-weather) cases encountered in real-life like tunnels, vehicle in garage, etc.\nTo improve WeathercAIm to suit the actual field production conditions, a more data centric approach is followed.\nFor this, ground-truth", 517, 830], ["what is the app superproductivity do", 8, 421], ["Which trees dows the paw flounder eat?", 10, 96], ["What is the best way to tell someone you want a divorce", 12, 539], ["in regards to computers i recall seeing a thing called a KVM which was supposed to be used to switch the monitor and keyboards and mouse between computers, as in sharing one set between two or more computers.

This can be done through tax holidays, accelerated capital allowances, tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, reduced rates, and other fiscal initiatives. These measures can make sustainability projects more attractive to businesses by reducing the cost of investment.\n\u2022\tTax holidays: These are temporary exemptions or reductions of CIT for a specified period of time for qualifying investments or activities, such as renewable energy generation, green manufacturing, or environmental protection.\n\u2022\tAccelerated capital allowance: These are deductions for the cost of capital assets at a faster rate than the normal capital allowance schedule, which reduces the taxable income and the effective tax rate for qualifying investments or activities, such as energy-efficient equipment, electric vehicles, or waste management facilities.\n\u2022\tTax credits: These are direct reductions of the tax liability for a specified amount or percentage of the qualifying investments or expenditures, such as research and development, green innovation, or environmental remediation.\n\u2022\tTax deductions: These are reductions of the taxable income for a specified amount or percentage of the qualifying investments or expenditures, such as employee training, social contributions, or donations to environmental causes.\n\u2022\tTax exemptions provide a full or partial exemption of qualifying taxable income and apply on a temporary or permanent basis.\n\u2022\tReduced rates are CIT rates set below the standard rate that apply on a temporary or permanent basis.\n\u2022\tTax allowances may relate to current expenditure (e.g., operation expenses) or capital expenditure. Tax allowances may allow for a faster write-off of the value of capital expenditure from taxable income up to 100% of incurred costs (i.e., acceleration) or can go beyond 100% of acquisition cost (i.e., enhancement). This could include, for example, allowing firms to deduct 150% of the value of a new machine. Tax allowances for current expenditure are always enhancing.\n\u2022\tImport duties: These are taxes or fees that are levied on goods that are imported into a country.

Friends and family is an often overlooked source of investment funds. While this may not be the right option for everyone, there are several advantages to consider.\n\nQuitting Your Day Job. Investment from friends and family may provide you with enough capital to transform your side hustle into your full-time gig. This can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs who have been working on their business idea in their spare time but need to focus on it full-time to take it to the next level. Dedicating more time and energy to your startup will often lead to faster growth and success.\nBuilding an MVP. Investment from friends and family can provide you with enough capital to build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test your idea and see if there is a market for it. This is particularly important for startups that are still in the early stages of development and may not yet have a proven business model. With additional funding, you can invest in market research, product development, and marketing efforts that can help you better understand your target audience and refine your business model.

All prior polynomial-time learners require additional assumptions on the network, such as positive combining coefficients or the matrix of hidden weight vectors being well-conditioned.\n\nOur approach is based on analyzing random contractions of higher-order moment tensors.

We will instantiate it as a sequence-to-sequence model which uses the BART architecture, and initialize it with the bart-large pretrained weights.\n\nIn short, the BART paper uses a denoising auto-encoder style objective to pre-train an encoder-decoder model (similarly to how masked language modeling is used to pre-trained BERT-style encoders). Among other applications, they show that large-scale pre-training with their objective followed by fine-tuning on ELI5 data yields the state-of-the-art ROUGE performance for the original version of the dataset (which uses pre-computed support documents made from CommonCrawl pages).\n\nWe provide the concatenation of the question and support document as input to the model, and train the decoder to minimize the perplexity of the gold answer. One notable choice is that we train the model using all high-scoring answers in the training set, so the model will see several instances of the same question-document input with different outputs. The supporting passages are separated by a special token <P>, so the input for our running example will look like:\n\nquestion: Why does water heated to room temperature feel colder than the air around it? context: \\<P> when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses ... this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. \\<P> protected by a glass panel. Consequently, these types of collectors...

Fluids\u2014especially gases\u2014are less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. The process of heat transfer\n\nThe first thing we do is pre-compute the support documents for the training and validation sets so we can use all available GPUs to train the sequence-to-sequence model.

We captured 768 clones spanning stages I and II and 1,213 clones spanning stages II and III (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3B; Table S2). After proving the transcriptomic similarity of sister cells at stages I and II (Figures S4AS4D), we quantitatively analyzed the lineage relationships between different cross-stage cell-type pairs by potential-spective or origin-spective analyses and identi\ufb01ed many previously uncharacterized converging or diverging trajectories (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3D\u2013S3G). For diverging trajectories, we found that NP pHB and NP MHB had multilineage fates from stages I to II or stages II to III. The NP pHB in stage I (I-NPpHB ) could differentiate into II-NPpHB , Motors, and Seros at stage II, and II-NP pHB produced progenies with more diverging fates including NPpHB , Gluts, Motors, Seros, and GABAs at stage III (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4E). The NP MHB at stage I (I-NPMHB ) could differentiate into II-NP MHB and Gluts at stage II, and II-NP MHB could give rise to III-NP aHB and III-NP vMB at stage III (Figures 3C and 3D). For converging trajectories, we found that II-NP MHB and II-NPaHB  could convergently differentiate into III-NPaHB , and both IINP MHB and II-NP vMB could give rise to III-NP vMB (Figures 3C and 3D). We also identi\ufb01ed non-bifurcating lineage trajectories. For instance, NP vMB were unipotent and speci\ufb01cally differentiated into later-stage NP vMB from differentiation stages I to III (Figures 3C and 3D). Of note, we observed non-overlapping lineage relationships for some pairs of cross-stage cell types inspected from potential-spective or origin-spective analyses (Figures 3C and 3D), possibly because clonal cells are randomly distributed to different objects in the null hypotheses of these two analyses, demonstrating that potential-spective or origin-spective analyses serve different purposes (Figures S4F and S4G). By summarizing all the cross-stage clonal data, we generated a multi-level lineage tree containing all cell types and signi\ufb01cant lineage relationships (p % 0.05 in either potential-spective or origin-spective analysis) across stages I to IV, depicting the complete lineage landscape of human ventral midbrain-hindbrain differentiation in vitro (Figure 3E).", 645, 404], ["Write a explicit story about a man being turned into a horse by a stallion mounting and claiming the man as a mate.

AI, both a scientific discipline and a term for intelligent computer systems, encompasses several subfields such as robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and safety. AI tools that generate content like text and images have gained significant attention recently, with OpenAI's AI tools attracting 100 million active users by February 2023. The primary technologies behind these tools are artificial neural networks and machine learning, which have been in existence for decades. The progression in this domain occurred with the advent of deep learning and transformer architecture, leading to the development of Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) architecture. The term \"Generative\" implies that these models not only encode information but also generate it, while \"Pretrained\" means that the model's underlying network and weights are already estimated and do not require continuous or specific training. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 can hold advanced conversations with humans through a standard interchange involving prompts and responses. LLMs are used in various applications from online search assistants to clinical therapeutic assistants and are rapidly becoming commonplace. The potential for widespread use of LLMs could have significant implications for public mental health, psychiatric care, and mental health research.\n\nThe \"Potential Implications for Population Mental Health\" section explores the various benefits and drawbacks of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mental health. On the positive side, LLMs can quickly assimilate patient data, summarize therapy sessions, and assist with complex diagnostic problems, potentially saving considerable time and effort for users. They can also act as personal assistants, aiding individuals in managing their daily tasks and priorities.\n\nHowever, LLMs also pose risks. They could substitute human labor, possibly leading to declines in population mental health mirroring those experienced during economic downturns. The social nature of LLMs, with their friendly conversational output, also raises concerns. On one hand, it can enhance users' empathy and provide pleasant interactions. On the other hand, it may cause users to s", 469, 1049], ["Answer this question in short: \"Do you think anarchism somehow affects politics?\" using the context: \"Anarchist movements have also played a critical role in resisting state repression, police brutality, and surveillance, as well as in providing mutual aid and support to marginalized communities  However, anarchism's effectiveness and popularity compared to other political movements remain a subject of debate  While anarchism has inspired and influenced numerous social movements, it has often been marginalized and misrepresented by mainstream media and political discourse\", 'Anarchism, a political ideology that advocates for the abolition of all forms of government and hierarchical social structures, has had a significant impact on modern society, inspiring political, social, and cultural movements across the world  Despite being often misunderstood and maligned by mainstream political discourse, anarchism has played a crucial role in shaping political thought and activism in the modern era  Anarchist ideas and practices have influenced various social movements such as feminism, anti-colonialism, anti-racism, anti-fascism, environmentalism, and labor rights', \" Anarchist theories of direct action, mutual aid, and horizontal organizing have been adopted by social justice movements around the globe  Anarchism's impact on modern society is evident in the numerous anarchist movements and communities that exist today  From the squatters' movements in Europe to the Zapatista communities in Mexico, from the anarchist ", 279, 37], ["People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.\nWrite a response with examples along in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the \nclaim.
